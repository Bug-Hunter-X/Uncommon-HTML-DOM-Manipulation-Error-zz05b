This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to DOM manipulation in HTML. The error occurs when JavaScript code attempts to access and modify a DOM element before the browser has fully parsed and rendered that element. This often leads to a null or undefined error because the element does not yet exist in the DOM tree.  The solution demonstrates a proper approach to ensure the script runs after the element is available.
